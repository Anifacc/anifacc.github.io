## BELIEVE

> In life, some may walk, others may run, but remember the Lord gave the tortoise and the horse the same days to reach Noah's ark. Your journey might be rough and tough but you will definitely get to your destination. 

> Jacob looked at Joseph and saw a good son! The ten brothers looked at Joseph and saw a useless dreamer! The travellers looked at Joseph and saw a slave!! Potiphar looked at Joseph and saw a fine servant!! Potiphar' s wife looked at Joseph and saw a potential boyfriend! The prison officers saw in Joseph a prisoner! How wrong were all of them! God looked at Joseph and saw a Prime Minister of Egypt in waiting!! Don' t be discouraged by what people see in you!! Be encouraged by what God sees in you!! Never underrate the person next to you because you never know what the Lord has deposited in that person. Your maid may be a Chief Executive Officer in waiting for a company which shall employ your child. Your garden-boy may be a president in waiting. (Remember David got the anointing of becoming a King while he was a simple child herding sheep. Esther was a simple orphaned girl yet she was a Queen in waiting). Let's share God's love and make the world a better place to live. Show that love by sharing this message with those you love.


> IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW PEOPLE SEE YOU, IT MATTERS HOW GOD SEES YOU
> God is God:

	He doesn't care about *age*, no wonder he blessed Abraham.
	He doesn't care about *experience*, no wonder he chose David.
	He doesn't care about *gender,* no wonder he lifted Esther.
	He doesn't care about *your past*, no wonder he called Paul.
	He doesn't care about *your physical appearance*, no wonder he chose Zacchaeus
	(the shortest one).
	He doesn't care about *fluency in speech* , no wonder he chose Moses.
	He doesn't care about *your career*, no wonder he choose Mary Magdalene; a prostitute. 
	All I know is that my God never changes
	He never made *a promise he wouldn't keep*👌
	He never saw *a person he wouldn't help*👌
	He never heard *a prayer he wouldn't answer*👌
	🖼He never found *a soul he wouldn't love*👌
	He never found *a sinner he wouldn't forgive*👌

This is the kind of God I would like to commune with every day the moment I wake up. I strongly recommend Him to you .... HIS NAME IS __JESUS__.....
HALLELUIA..


## Hallelujah!
