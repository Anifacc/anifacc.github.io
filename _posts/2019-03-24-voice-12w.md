> I have only one method that I recommend extensively—it’s called think before you write. @Richard Hamming

> Clifford W. K.
W. K. Clifford is often quoted for his asseveration that "it is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence." 

From: [Evidence and Actuality: A Modal Punch at W. K. Clifford](https://maverickphilosopher.typepad.com/maverick_philosopher_stri/2018/11/evidence-and-actuality-a-modal-punch-at-w-k-clifford.html)

## One Thing

> Enthusiasm is infectious. Don’t waste your time hanging around people who try to belittle your dreams. @YouVersion Bible 

## T&E

> If people do not believe that mathematics is simple, it is only because they do not realize how complicated life is. @John von Neumann

## Invest

> “You take what you earn with the sweat of your brow, then you take a percentage of that and you invest it in other people’s labor,” Wertheim says of his near-religious devotion to tithing his wages into the stock market.

> “The essence of that approach was: to act on logic rather than emotion; to rely on quantitative rather than subjective analysis; to think for himself and ignore what other investors were saying and doing; and to approach the business of investment in a systematic way that reflected his own deep understanding of how the financial markets actually work.” Excerpt From: Nairn, Alasdair. “Templeton's Way With Money: Strategies and Philosophy of a Legendary Investor.” Wiley, 2012-02-07T07:16:58+00:00.

> “The paradox is that while the process he adopted was austere in its rigor, and firmly quantitative in its application, his philosophy was rooted less in dry analytical analysis of what works in financial markets than in his understanding of human psychology and behavior. The latter, he believed, was the primary factor that underpins the behavior of security prices and created the bargains for which he spent his life looking.” Excerpt From: Nairn, Alasdair. “Templeton's Way With Money: Strategies and Philosophy of a Legendary Investor.” Wiley, 2012-02-07T07:16:58+00:00.

> “Sir John’s religious and ethical beliefs cannot therefore be seen in isolation from his career as an investor. The reality is that he did not have two sets of fundamental principles—one for life and one for investment.” Excerpt From: Nairn, Alasdair. “Templeton's Way With Money: Strategies and Philosophy of a Legendary Investor.” Wiley, 2012-02-07T07:16:58+00:00.

> “After listing examples of pride and intolerance, Templeton also focused on the flaws in moral relativism, the notion that there are no absolute rights and wrongs, only degrees of wrongdoing. In his view economic utilitarianism, a doctrine to which many elected politicians are vulnerable, is “a version of moral relativism, because it pretends that profit and loss can substitute for right and wrong.” This view was behind Templeton’s unwillingness to invest in certain industries on moral grounds, including tobacco, alcohol, gambling, and pornography.” Excerpt From: Nairn, Alasdair. “Templeton's Way With Money: Strategies and Philosophy of a Legendary Investor.” Wiley, 2012-02-07T07:16:58+00:00.

## Humanity

> “争辩、抱怨和反驳或许会带来暂时的胜利，但你永远无法通过这表面上的胜利赢得对方的尊敬。” @人性的弱点

> 本杰明富兰克林 三百年前，伽利略也曾说过：“你无法教会他人，唯一能做的，只是引导他自行领悟。” @人性的弱点

> 这段话摘自詹姆斯·哈维·罗宾逊的作品《理智的形成》（The Mind in the Making）。 有时我们会在不知不觉之间转变想法，并对此毫无抵触。然而被人指出错误的时候，我们却拒绝改变，并且狠狠关上心门。我们毫不在意自己的价值观如何莫名成型，却在他人质疑之时，对这些价值观陡增感情。珍贵的并非价值观，而是受到威胁的自尊心。“我的”——这个不起眼的词汇是人类事务中最重要的词汇，人类对这个词的认识是智慧的开始。无论是“我的”晚餐，“我的”狗，“我的”房子，还是“我的”父亲，“我的”国家，“我的”信仰，这个定语都具有不可小觑的力量。我们不仅厌恶别人指责我们的表不准、车子破，更厌恶别人指责我们对事物的看法——无论是火火星河道的位置、“埃皮克提图”的读音、水杨苷的药性还是萨尔贡的年代。我们总是固守那些早已成型的认知，一旦遭受质疑，我们就会心生抵触，为了保护自己认定的事实而寻找各种理由。结果导致我们所宣称的“理性”，实际上只是徒然地捍卫自己的成见而已。@人性的弱点 

> 认真问问自己：“如果我是他，我会怎么想，又会怎么做？”这会为你节省时间，避开不必要的麻烦，你的人际交往能力也会因此日益精进。“一旦理解了昨日之因，我们就不再纠结于今日之果。” @人性的弱点 

> “人人心间都有恐惧，唯有勇士能够放下恐惧，奋勇前行。即使战死沙场，也是值得自豪的胜利。”古希腊国王的侍卫以这句话为座右铭。战胜对死亡的恐惧大概是人世间最大的挑战。 @人性的弱点
