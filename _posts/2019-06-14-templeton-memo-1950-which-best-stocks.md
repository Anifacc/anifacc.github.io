## Which are the Best Stocks^[1]

From: Letter to Clients December 1950

After an investor has decided the percentage of total funds which he should keep in common stocks, then he faces the problem of selecting the best stocks. The investor does not wish to purchase a list of stocks selected at random, but rather he wishes to purchase only those stocks which are the best.

Some people, especially institutional investors and trustees, use the words “best stocks” to mean stocks of “high investment quality.” Stocks of high investment quality are those having a tendency to rise very little in favorable markets and to decline very little in unfavorable markets. These are usually stocks of large and famous corporations, having a long record of steady dividends. It is a simple matter for an experience investor to make a list of those stocks having high investment quality. There is little disagreement among security analysts in determining which stocks deserve this rating.

Other people use the words “best stocks” to mean stocks having “a good short-term outlook.” In fact, this is the viewpoint most frequently used in selecting stocks. A stock may be selected because the company is expected to pay an extra dividend, because the company is expected to have an increase in sales volume next year, or because of a rumor that the stock may be split. This tendency to emphasize the temporary outlook is the cause for the wide fluctuation in price which most stocks undergo every year.

Now when we use the words “best stocks,” we mean simply the best values—that is to say, those stocks whose market prices are lowest in relation to their intrinsic value. The question of investment quality and the question of short-term outlook are only two among the multitude of factors which must be computed and combined in the complex task of estimating the intrinsic value. For each stock we arrive at a specific estimate of intrinsic value. These estimates are kept up-to-date by frequent review. Each month the market price for each stock is compared with the estimated intrinsic value of that stock.

When the market price for a particular stock rises above intrinsic value to an unreasonable extent, we notify clients holding that stock and suggest that the stock should be sold. Conversely, when the market price falls below the intrinsic value for a particular stock to an unreasonable extent, we put that stock on a list of “stocks which can be recommended to clients for purchase.”

To appraise the value of a stock the analyst must consider not just one or two but all factors. Some of these factors are management ability, growth trend, government control, assets per share, average past market prices for the shares, dividends, current earnings, average earnings in previous years, estimates of future earnings, etc.

The appraisal of value is complex and subject to numerous uncertainties. It should not be expected that all selections made on this basis, or any other basis, can prove successful. But although the “intrinsic value” is only an estimate, the person or company whose studies are crystalized logically, systematically and consistently into a specific estimate has an advantage over other stock purchasers and sellers whose ideas are often nebulous and incomplete. A comprehensive and systematic analysis reduces the human tendency to overemphasize one or two dramatic factors and overlook others.

The investor who purchases a stock because of basic value can enjoy a certain peace of mind. If after purchasing a stock at a low price in relation to value, the price continues to decline, then it is simply a better bargain than it was before. On the other hand, the speculator who purchases in the hope of a quick profit places himself at the mercy of market fluctuations, because he can succeed only by selling his shares to other speculators at higher prices.

The investor who selects stocks on the basis of long-term intrinsic value must expect certain problems. In the first place, he should expect usually to purchase stocks which are thoroughly unpopular. Only when a stock is unpopular is the price likely to be depressed greatly below intrinsic value. It is not easy to act contrary to popular opinion. When the price of a stock is very low, there are usually obvious reasons which have caused others to sell the shares and thereby depress the price. 

For example, after the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor the outlook for the automobile industry was recognized as unfavorable. It was widely predicted that the manufacture of automobiles might be stopped completely. Shares of General Motors sold as low as 28⅝. The manufacture of automobiles was in fact stopped completely a few months later and not resumed for several years. However, the bargain hunters, who were willing to act against public opinion and purchase General Motors below 30 after Pearl Harbor, were well rewarded because the shares were later split 2-for-1 and are now selling at 47.

In the second place, the investor who selects stocks on the basis of long-term intrinsic value should not expect that the stocks selected will immediately begin to show a profit. If the intrinsic value of a stock is estimated at $40 and then over a period of years unfavorable news depresses the price to $20, the investor may begin to buy this stock because it appears to be one of the best bargains in the market. However, it would be an unusual coincidence if he should happen to make the purchase just at the time when the downward trend is reversed. Ordinarily the downward trend persists for at least a few weeks and sometimes much longer. The investor may hold the shares for a long time before others begin to recognize the intrinsic value.

Usually a stock selected for purchase because its market price is very low in relation to intrinsic value sooner or later attracts public favor so that the market price rises above intrinsic value. Even if the stock does not become popular, however, the investment may prove lucrative in the long run. For example, if you can purchase at $20 a stock having $20 a share in assets, earning 20 percent annually on assets and paying out half of earnings, then simply by holding this stock for five years you will receive more than $10 in dividends and more than $10 in the form of increased assets per share. In other words, you may obtain even 100 percent profit on the investment even though the stock continues to be unpopular and sells equally low in relation to earnings, dividends and asset values. Whenever you can buy a large amount of future earning power for a low price, you have made a good investment.
