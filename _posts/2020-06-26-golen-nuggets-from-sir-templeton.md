Golden Nuggets from Sir John Templeton

## 简介

> 1.Happiness comes from spiritual wealth, not material wealth. 
幸福源于灵性（精神）财富，而非物质财富。

> 2.The world operates on spiritual principles just as it operates on the laws of physics and gravity. It is up to us to learn what these principles are and then choose to live by them. Spiritual laws are impartial because they apply equally to everyone throughout the world. They work without prejudice or bias at all times and in all places. These laws are self-enforcing and are not dependent on human authority or commandments.

世界运行在灵性（精神）定律之上，就像它运行在物理和重力定律上一样。我们有责任了解这些原则是什么，然后选择遵守它们。灵性定律不偏不倚，因为它们平等地适用于世界上的每个人。这些定律在任何时候任何地方都不带偏见地运作。这些定律自我执行，不依赖于人类的权威或命令。

> It has been said that “life is a tough school because the exams come first and the learning afterwards.” This book is a sincere attempt to provide some opportunities for learning so you will be prepared for the exams that will come.

有人说“生活是一所艰苦的学校，因为考试在前，学习在后。”这本书尝试提供一些学习的机会为即将到来的考试做好准备。

## 感恩 Thanksgiving

> We have the ability to create blessings in our lives through the power of our minds and the choices we make.

我们有能力通过心智力量和选择在生活中创造幸福。

> Thanksgiving opens the door to spiritual growth.

感恩会打开灵命成长之门。

> Thanksgiving leads to having more to give thanks for.

感恩，会带来更多的感谢。

> Praise, not complaining, increases the good and the blessing in whatever it is directed toward. When we speak words of praise as our consistent, joyous response to life, we increase the good and draw out the best in others.

赞美，而不是抱怨，会增加良善和祝福。当我们说赞美的话作为我们对生活的一贯的、快乐的回应时，我们增强了他人的优点，也汲取了他人的优点。

> Thanksgiving, not complaining, attracts people to you.

感恩，能吸引人，抱怨却不会。

> Thanksgiving leads to giving and forgiving, and to spiritual growth.

感恩会带来给予和宽恕，以及灵命成长。

> When we are grateful for the blessings we already have, our very gratitude attracts extra good to us. Gratitude nurtures within us a positive, joy-filled consciousness and unifies us with life’s flow, which gives birth to inner fulfillment.

当我们感激我们已经拥有的祝福时，我们的感激之情会给我们带来额外的好处。感恩在我们体内培育了一种积极的、充满喜悦的意识，并使我们与生命的流动相结合，从而产生内在的满足感。

> An attitude of gratitude creates blessings.

感恩的态度会带来幸福。

> Count your blessings and you will have an attitude of gratitude.

数算你的祝福，你会获得感恩的态度。

实践：每日感恩、赞美、祷告。感恩生命中的所有，赞美创造万物的主，为现在以及未来祷告。

## 宽恕&祷告 Forgiveness & Prayer

> Forgiveness can be about knowing that although we experience pain, we don’t have to experience long-term suffering. The faith expressed through giving thanks for our challenges can help dissolve the appearance of negative circumstances and, as we give thanks and forgive, we are uplifted.

宽恕是知道虽然会经历痛苦，但不必经历长期的痛苦。感谢面临的挑战这一信念能帮助化解负面环境影响，当给予感谢和宽恕时，我们会感到振奋。

> Forgiveness benefits both the giver and the receiver.

> To be forgiven, you must first forgive.

> Forgiving uplifts the forgiver.

爱和祷告。

> An important thing to remember is that whatever kind of confusion may be around you, what is within your own consciousness is what counts. **And you have available two of the most powerful tools to use—love and prayer**.

值得牢记一件重要事情是，无论你周围有什么样的困惑，你自己意识中的东西才是最重要的。你可以使用两个最强大的工具——爱和祷告。

> You have the most powerful
weapons on earth—love and prayer.

我有地球上最强大的两个武器---爱和祷告。

> Through prayer you receive spiritual energy.

祷告，能让我精神之力。

## 积极思考 Positive Thinking

> Concentrate your thoughts on the good, the beautiful, and the true things of life. This positive attitude can help you perceive the presence of God active in your life and put into operation the divine magic that can open doors to greater usefulness and joy.

思想集中在生活的美好、美丽和真实的事物上。这种积极态度可以帮助你感知上帝在生命中的存在，并运用神圣的魔法，打开更大的通往实用和快乐之门。

> Beautiful thoughts build a beautiful soul.

美好想法构建美好心灵。

> A measure of mental health is the disposition to find good everywhere.

不论何时何地，去发现生活中的美好。

> Enthusiasm facilitates achievement. Enthusiasm is contagious.

想要有所成就，就要保持积极热情。没有热情，做事难以成功。当然，光有热情还不过，需要有实际的行动。

热情会传染给他人。每日保持热情吧。

> Expect the best and your positive outlook opens the door to opportunity.

凡事期待最美好的事情发生，积极乐观的态度打开机会之门。

> You find what you look for: good or evil, problems or solutions.

找到了你想要的:好的或坏的，问题或解决方法。你会如何选择（Only we can make choices, and the choices shape us.）

## 爱 Love

```
Many people needlessly seem to make their lives
difficult by failing to realize the importance of the
thoughts and attitudes they send out. Begin cleaning
out those things in your mind that you know
make for more problems, such as resentment,
self-pity, blaming others, anger.

Know that there is no power in the universe greater
than love, and no act more important than loving.
Agape is the unselfish love that gives of itself and
expects nothing in return. It is the love that grows
as you give it to others.
```

> You get back what you give out.

所获即所给。

> Agape given grows, agape hoarded dwindles.

爱，散，则成长。
爱，聚，则消减。

> One of the keys of prosperity is realizing that true prosperity doesn’t come by getting more—it comes by giving more! 

> By giving you grow.

> The more love we give, the more love we have left.

施比受更为有福。

> Love given is love received.

> As you are active in blessing others, they find their burdens easier to bear.

成为他人的祝福。

> You cannot be lonely if you help the lonely.

> Help yourself by helping others.

助人即助己

> The gifts of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control are gifts of a humble and sincere individual and come directly from the heart.

爱、喜乐、和平、耐心、良善、忠诚、温柔和自律是谦逊和真诚的人的礼物，它们直接源自内心。

> You are sought after if you reflect love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.

如果你有爱、喜乐、和平、耐心、善良、忠诚、温柔和自律，你就会被追求。

> 聖靈所結的果子，就是仁愛、喜樂、和平、忍耐、恩慈、良善、信實、 溫柔、節制；--- 加拉太書 5:22-23 

## 谦卑 Humility

> A successful life involves personal relationships, family experiences, and spiritual involvement, as well as our professional lives. There may be many life possibilities for each of us. Success is finding out which of these may be the most meaningful, working hard for these dreams, and giving credit for the help and guidance necessary to fulfill them.

成功的生活包括个人关系、家庭经历、灵性投入以及职业生活。每个人都有很多生活可能性。成功是找出其中最有意义的，为梦想努力奋斗，赞扬那些为实现这些梦想所需的帮助和指导。

> The true meaning of humility is knowing that the personal self is a vehicle of a higher power.

人，高阶生命或力量的创造之物。认清这一点，懂得谦逊。

> Give credit and help to all who have helped you.

赞美，并帮助那些帮助过你的人。

> Great heroes are humble.

伟大人物是谦逊之人。

> Humility leads to prayer as well as progress and brings you in tune with the Infinite. 

谦逊会带来祈祷和进步，并让你与无限和谐一致。

> Humility opens the door to progress.

> If you think you know it all, you are less likely to learn more.

你认为自己懂了所有，那么你不太可能学到更多。

> It is better to praise than to criticize.

赞美胜于批评。

> Our quantity of spiritual knowledge is smaller than Ptolemy’s knowledge of astronomy.

我们知晓灵性知识的量远远小于托勒密的天文学知识。

> The unknown is not unknowable and is vastly greater than the known.

未知不是不可知的，它比已知的要大得多。

## 幸福 Happiness

> Begin to practice the belief that you have a significant part to play in life and take steps to discover what that is. 

人生在世，使命在肩，去发现自己的使命。

> The secret of a productive life can be sought and found.

丰饶生活的秘密可以找寻或发现。

> You can build your own heaven or hell on earth.

在地球上，你能建造自己的天堂，也能创造地狱。

> People devote much time and energy to seeking happiness, but the sad fact is that we are often seeking it outside ourselves. Actually, the happiest people are those who are working to give happiness to others. Happiness is not found by seeking it; it is a by-product of caring about other people.

幸福不是外找寻得。它是关爱他人的“副产品”。

```
True and lasting happiness comes from spiritual wealth
because, with it, we have a resource to draw upon. With
spiritual wealth as the foundation and security
for our lives, we gain a deep and abiding peace that
cannot be obtained with material wealth alone.
```

> Happiness is always a by-product.

幸福一直以来都是“副产品”。刻意在外追求，不会寻得。

> Happiness comes from spiritual wealth, not material wealth.

幸福源自于灵性财富，而非物质财富。

> Happiness pursued, eludes; happiness given, returns.

幸福，追求就消逝；幸福，给予就获得。

> If you do not know what you want to achieve with your life, you may not achieve much.

如果你不知道你想在生活中实现什么，你可能实现不了什么。

```
When we begin to realize that joy comes from within us,
we can communicate this joy to others and also gain a
wonderful feeling of confidence in knowing that others
may receive happiness from the expressions
we give to life!
```

喜乐，从内追寻并分享于他人。

> Joy provides assurance; envy brings loneliness.

喜乐者自信；嫉妒者孤独。

> Joy is not in things, but is in you.

喜乐源于你自己，而非外在事物。

## 进步 Progress

```
Wherever we are and whatever we are doing,
it is possible to learn something that can enrich our lives
and the lives of others. It may be necessary to release
outmoded ways of thinking and acting in order to try
something new but, when we do, life becomes more
exciting and fulfilling than we dreamed possible.

We can all learn from the experiences in life, and we can
also learn from not learning when life gives us another
opportunity. If we use this opportunity to expand our
understanding, it will not be seen as a defeat,
only another chance to learn and grow!
```

> No one’s education is ever complete.

一个人的教育，永不止步。自教育非常重要，一个离开校园成年人，必须懂得自教育。

> Only one thing is more powerful than learning from experience, and that is not learning from experience!

只有一件事比从经验中学习更强大，那就是不要从经验中学习！不从经验中学习，或者拒绝学习力量更多强大，后果影响也比从经验中学习强大。

> The way to make conscious change, achieve new goals, and perfect our skills is through diligent practice and study on a consistent basis. This means making the commitment to develop our self-discipline and to persist and endure until the goal is met. Don’t give up easily! You have the ability to make striking progress in the pursuit of your goals.

不断改变、实现新目标和完善我们技能的方法是通过坚持不懈的勤奋练习和学习。这意味着我们要自律，要坚持并坚持到目标实现。不要轻易放弃！你有能力在追求目标的过程中取得惊人的进步。

> Progress requires change. 

进步需要改变。

> Progress depends on diligence and perseverance.

进步取决于勤奋和毅力。

```
To be an innovator, an entrepreneur, you must
first recognize that you have within you the power
to be creative. Next, be willing to try new experiences,
to discover new fields that may offer opportunities for
development. Being open and receptive can teach us much
about the world and help sincere and creative individuals
become innovative entrepreneurs.

Rather than being consumed with problems and limitations,
we can rise above them to allow divine inspiration to guide us
to better solutions. When we rule our minds in a positive
way, we choose the path we want to walk down.
```

> World progress needs entrepreneurs.

世界进步需要企业家。

> You choose the path you want to walk down.

你选择你想走的路。

```
Dreams, visions, ideas can play significant roles
in our lives. They can entice, entertain, or inspire us to
greatness. To bring them into reality, however, we must act!
Cowardice and lack of faith can keep one from a
chosen goal, but if the heart is strong and brave, you can
add action to your dreams and make them real.

Keeping an eye on the vision becomes necessary throughout
the process. Focus on where you want to go, instead of where
you have been. Much valuable time can be wasted in getting
bogged down in past experiences or mistakes.
After learning from past experiences, continue forward
optimistically toward your goals
```

> Your dreams can come true when you activate them.

当你努力行动时，你的梦想终会实现。

> Focus on where you want to go, instead of where you have been.

关注你想去的地方，而不是你去过的地方。

## 成就 Success

```
Sometimes, when we experience misfortune, if we
remember that God is there in the midst of the confusion
we can be better able to deal with situations in a positive,
loving way. Experiences come to us for a purpose and, when
we follow the guidance of the spirit within, we may find
that the purpose is a good one. 

We cannot have productive lives if we live with the constant
fear of avoiding mistakes and misfortunes. Staying within
known boundaries may avoid mistakes, but it can also prevent
life from becoming rich and exciting. If you are committed
to growth, you learn that each new situation finds you
better able to cope with new challenges.
```

恐惧失败、错误和不幸，不可能获得丰饶生活。不惧困难，迎接挑战，生命才有可能。

> Misfortune can bring blessings.

不幸，能够带来祝福。比如约伯。

> Those who seldom make mistakes seldom make discoveries

少犯错者，少发现。

```
It takes courage to face the challenges of life.
When we keep in reserve an alternate plan
for our livelihood, we can have the strength to do
whatever we need to do. Find your source.
Live from it. And keep your heart open.

Look for the positive in what may seem to be
a negative situation. Learn how to live in harmony
with others in ways that may lead to productive change.
These things are part of “being prepared”
and often lead to success.
```

培养迎接挑战的勇气；为生活留有Plan B；挖掘潜力；开放心灵。

在逆境中积极思考；和他人和谐相处；凡事多准备。

> Everyone should keep in reserve an alternate plan for livelihood.

每个人都应为生计留有备用计划(Plan B)。

> Preparedness is a step to success.

凡事预者立。

> Worry is one way to meet life, but self-responsibility can be the better way. While worry stems from fear, self-responsibility comes from faith in God, faith in the goodness of life, faith in the universe, and faith in our own potential. Among the numerous ways to meet life’s challenges, one of the most destructive is worrying about it. 

忧虑是面对生活的一种方式，但自我负责可能是更好的方式。虽然担忧源于恐惧，但自我责任来自对上帝的信仰、对生命美好的信仰、对宇宙的信仰以及对我们自身潜力的信仰。

在众多应对生活挑战的方法中，最具破坏性的一种就是担心生活。

> Another way of dealing with problems is often to lash out at other people when we are feeling down. Besides causing unnecessary pain and suffering to those around us, our negative words frequently compound our own problems. How much wiser it is to hold our tongues until we can see the larger picture and know that the bad moments do pass.

另一种处理问题的方法是，当我们情绪低落的时候，经常对别人进行抨击。除了给我们周围的人带来不必要的痛苦和折磨之外，我们的负面话语经常会加重我们自己的问题。保持沉默，直到我们看到更广阔的前景，知道糟糕的时刻已经过去，这是多么明智的一件事。

> Worry achieves nothing and wastes valuable time.

担忧，一无所获，除了浪费宝贵时间。

> Destructive language tends to produce destructive results.

破坏性的语言往往会产生破坏性的结果。

> If we can learn to take responsibility for every area of our lives, we can also choose to create in our lives the direction and focus we need. One of the best ways to exhibit self-control is to know that faith, not fear; love, not hate; joy, not sorrow; peace, not tension; freedom, not bondage are the fundamentals of success. 

如果我们能学会对生活的每个方面负责，我们也能选择去在生活中创造我们需要的方向和焦点。展示自我控制的最好方法之一是具有信心，而不是恐惧；爱，而不是恨；快乐，而不是悲伤；和平，而不是紧张；自由而不是束缚，这些是成功的基础。

> Success takes practice, and if you want to feel like a success, it is important for you to begin to acknowledge your successes right now. Listen to the encouragement you receive from parents, teachers, employers, and friends. As you build on success, you may discover that you can create this again and again in various aspects of living.

成功需要实践，如果你想获得成功，现在就开始承认你的成功是很重要的。倾听父母、老师、雇主和朋友给你的鼓励。当你建立在成功的基础上，你会发现你可以在生活的各个方面一次又一次地创造成功。

> Self-control leads to success. 

自律or自我管理，引领你走向成功。

> Success feeds on itself and creates more success.

“成功”也存在“马太效应”。成就孕育更多的成就。

## 良好生活方式 Useful Living

> If we believe in a progressive, forward-moving existence with wonderful potential, we will be living an interesting life. A big difference between happiness and misery, success and failure, effectiveness and uselessness, cannot be blamed on circumstances or other people. The condition of your mind creates your reality. 

如果我们相信一个进步的、向前发展的、有着美好潜力的存在，我们将过着有趣的生活。幸福与痛苦、成功与失败、效率与无用之间的巨大差异，不能归咎于环境或其他人。你的精神状态创造了你的现实。

> When the pattern of your life is woven around a positive, generous approach to life, people will often react the same way toward you. Our importance to others depends on showing through our actions that we sincerely care about them. 

当你的生活模式围绕着积极、慷慨的生活方式时，人们通常会对你做出同样的反应。我们对他人的重要性取决于通过我们的行动表明我们真诚地关心他们。

> Nothing is interesting if you are not interested.

如果不敢兴趣，万物都无趣。

> It’s nice to be important, but it’s more important to be nice.

重要固然好，但更重要的是良善。

> In order to be happy, healthy and stress free, it is important to believe in yourself and your individual right to happiness and health. Take time to be out of doors. The beauty of the earth can stimulate joy, thanksgiving, and healthy thoughts. Learn to laugh and to be silent. Love your children and play with your pets. Life is to be lived and enjoyed!

为了快乐、健康和没有压力，相信你自己拥有个人幸福和健康的权利是很重要的。花点时间出去逛逛。地球之美可以激发快乐、感恩和健康的思想。学会笑，学会沉默。爱你的孩子，和你的宠物一起玩。生活就是生活和享受！

> Probably the greatest secret to peace of mind is living the life of personal integrity—not what people think of you, but what you know of yourself. If you remain true to your ethical principles, your personal integrity can become an attractive beacon for success on every level. Listen carefully to the inner promptings of conscience and live peacefully.

内心平静的最大秘密也许是过正直的生活——不是人们对你的看法，而是你对自己的了解。如果你坚持自己的道德原则，你的正值会成为在各个层面上取得成功的一盏迷人的明灯。仔细倾听良心的内在激励，平静地生活。

> Healthy minds tend to cause healthy bodies and vice versa.

健康的思想会导致健康的身体，反之亦然。

> Change your mind to change your life.

改变思维，改变生活。

> Over and over we hear that giving makes it more possible to receive; however, the purpose for which we give is vital. To give with the secret hope of reward is in direct opposition to the law of love. True giving, with no strings attached, manifests love and, in the process, increases understanding. Those who do good do well.

我们一次又一次地听到给予使接受变得更有可能；然而，我们给予的目的是至关重要的。喜欢得到回报的给予是与爱的法则直接对立的。真正的给予，没有任何附加条件，体现了爱，并且在这个过程中，增加了理解。做好事的人才能做得好。

> A real economic healing activity is to tithe, or give. It is found that tithing establishes a consistent method of giving and stewarding the bounty in one’s life. Through this we increase our awareness about supply, abundance, and further giving. One can observe that the family that tithes for more than ten years becomes both prosperous and happy!

一个真正的经济修复活动是奉献或给予。人们发现，什一税建立了一个人一生中给予和管理慷慨的一致方法。通过这种方式，我们提高了对供给、富足和进一步给予的意识。人们可以观察到，什一奉献超过十年的家庭变得既繁荣又幸福！

> Those who do good do well.

那些做好事之人做事做得好。

> Tithing often brings prosperity and honor.

十一奉献带来繁荣和荣耀。

> Much has been written about the power of the spoken word; in fact, our words are instruments of sound with which we build our world. The more we keep our word, the stronger and more creative it will be. If we say what we mean and mean what we say, our words can become the building blocks of a positive life.

关于话语的力量已经写了很多；事实上，我们的语言是声音的工具，我们用它来建造我们的世界。我们越遵守诺言，它就越强大，越有创造力。如果我们的所说即所想，所想即所说，我们的话就能成为积极生活的基石。

> As we choose to live our lives in a useful manner and in harmony with the laws of life, that which we do can be a meaningful ministry of service to others. By loving your job, holding the attitude that it may be accomplished from the perspective of doing good work for others, you are fulfilling a ministry of service. To the one who faces the light, the path is bright! 

当我们选择以一种有用的方式生活，并与生活的法则和谐相处时，我们所做的事情可以成为一种有意义的服务他人的工作。通过热爱你的工作，保持为他人做好工作的态度，你就完成了服务的使命。对于面对光明的人来说，道路是光明的！

> You are only as good as your word.

言出必行。你的所作就是你自己。

> Every useful life is a ministry.

每一个有用的生命都是一个神职。
