## Intro

- 书名: Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits and Other Writings 
- By Philip A.Fisher
- 出版社: John Wiley & Sons
- ISBN 0-471-44550-9

> This book is dedicated to all investors, large and small, who do NOT adhere to the philosophy: "I have already made up my mind, don't confuse me with facts."

投资莫要掩耳盗铃, 自欺欺人, 贪婪成性.

书籍分三部分内容, 其实也就是三本小册子组合成一本书.

- Common stocks and uncommon profits
- Conservative investors sleep well
- Develop an investment philosophy.

书本前言由P.A.Fisher的儿子 K.Fisher完成, K介绍自己阅读父亲书籍的经历, 书籍包含的一些内容, 以及自己的投资经历, 非常谦逊, 并强烈推荐投资者多阅读几遍他父亲的这本书.

> Working for my father was a bumpy ride, a bit like my first professional stock purchase---a reverse "ten bagger": it fell from ten to one. I tell you all this only so you can see that even a kid in his twenties, without a lifetime at the top of his school class, having never attended a big-name university, and with no major accomplishments under his belt to brag on, even that kid could go on and in just a few years learn to effectively use the principles in this book. And so can you.

Yeah, 股市无需天才.

## Fifteen Points

如果没买过一只股票, 你在买之前, 总要思考: 我该以怎样的价格买入这家公司呢看, 这时候何时买比合适卖相对重要一些.

> Fortunately, this book teaches that if you figure out the right things to buy, selling becomes a lot less important because you can hold the stocks you own longer. And what to buy derives directly from my father's fifteen points.

A.Fisher在本书中提出的一些理念, 在 K 看来:

> Scuttlebutt and the fifteen points work for growth stocks or value stocks, for big cap stocks or small cap stocks.

K 更多是偏向价值投资这, 而A是成长股投资者.

## P.A.Fisher

K 在介绍中详细介绍了他们家族和历史, 尤其是他的父亲 P.Fisher. 老Fisher是个不善于社会交际的人, 他阿姨给他送他的一辆汽车帮助了老Fisher. 老Fisher刚开始在UC-Berkely大学学习, 后来他阿姨资助他转到了斯坦福大学, 那里更友好一些.

> Stanford did not have an investment class as it does now; but as Father has described in other writings, there was then a class that traveled to visit and analyze local business.

因为老Fisher那时读大学时有车, 会开车, 重视载着他的教授 Boris Emmett 去企业采访. 这对老Fisher的影响还是潜移默化的诺.

P.Fisher 是给 3-W man: walk-worry-work.(1) 喜欢走路 (2) 常常 worry (3) 经常 工作.

## 写书缘由

> In studying the investment record both of myself and others, two matters were significant influences in causing this book to be written. (1) One, which I mention several times elsewhere, is the need for patience if big profits are to be made from investment. Put another way, it is often easier to tell what will happen to the price of a stock than how much time will elapse before it happens. (2) The other is the inherently deceptive nature of the stock market. Doing what everybody else is doing at the moment, and therefore what you have an almost irresistible urge to do, is often the wrong thing to do at all.

其实是为了解释给他的顾客听, 这样他的顾客才不会在不必要的时刻把钱退出, 而是放心交给P.Fisher管理. P.Fisher的客户没有超过12个.
