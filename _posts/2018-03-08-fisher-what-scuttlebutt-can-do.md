本篇是 Common stocks and uncommon profits 第二篇内容的笔记, 作者主要讲述 Scuttlebutt 是什么?

从上一篇的内容中(Clues from the Past), 你能找到那些未来会大幅增值的企业么? 只是有帮助, 而实际的操作还需要其他方法, 那么这个方法是什么呢?

> Granted that this furnishes a broad outline of the type of investment that should be sought, how does the investor go about finding the specific company which might open the way to major appreciation?

之后, 作者提到一种方法, 但是不可行, 不具现实性及使用价值.

> Fortunately, there is another course which the investor can pursue. If properly handled, this method will provide the clues that are needed to find really outstanding investments. For lack of a better term, I shall call this way of proceeding the "scuttlebutt" method.

- The business "grapevine" is a remarkable thing.
    - Competitors: 行业竞争对手中获取!(一个行业中询问其他公司, 关于同行公司的优点和缺点.)
    - vendors and customers: 企业的上下游公司(供应商和客户)
    - Research scientists in university, in goverment, and in competitive companies ...
    - Executives of trade associations.(同业公会, 商业团体, 行业协会的高管)
        - 一定要保密, 不能透露出渠道
    - former employees(前员工) 需要投资者自己去分析判断信息的准确性, 是否存在偏见(情绪影响).

自己思考, 还有没有其他的方法? 那么如何去做呢?

> If enough different sources of information are sought about a company, there is no reason to believe that each bit of data obtained should agree with each other bit of data. Actually, there is not the slightest need for this to happen. 

> In the case of really outstanding companies, the preponderant information is so crystal clear that even a moderately experienced investor who konws what he is seeking will be able to tell which companies are likely to be of enough interest to him to warrant taking the next step in his investigation. This next step is to contact the officers of the company to try and fill out some of the gaps still existing in the investor's picture of the situation being studied.
