## Questions[^1]

> Why was Templeton so sure that five-year forward earnings forecasts should be at the heart of his stock picking methods? Why five years rather than some other period? Why earnings rather than some other commonly used metric, such as cash flow or balance sheet analysis? (“In most cases, in assessing a company, we place more emphasis on future earnings rather than current earnings or assets. . . . The yardstick of value we have used most often is price relative to probable future earnings.”)

## Study Conclusions[^1]

按书中所述, [Alasdair/Sandy Nairn](https://www.edinburghpartners.com/staff/dr-sandy-nairn)研究了该问题.

> To do so, we draw on the findings of the detailed research that one of the current authors has been undertaking, in ever greater depth, since he first worked for the Templeton organization more than 15 years ago. As Director of Global Equity Research at Templeton Investment Management in the mid-1990s, he took it upon himself to start testing empirically some of the many investment ideas and hypotheses that John Templeton had come to believe in through his own studies and experience.

公司长期盈利, 股价, 投资收益的关系研究.

> One of the first of these that he set out to study was **the relationship between long-term earnings, share price performance, and investor returns**. This produced a set of results that, though based on just a single five-year period, so clearly and so emphatically reinforced the wisdom of John Templeton’s intuition that no further analysis seemed necessary at the time. Subsequently, however, and in order to test the validity of this initial finding more thoroughly, the study has been expanded across a wide range of other markets and periods to establish exhaustive and statistically robust conclusions.

但不知作者如何研究, 只给出了研究结果.

- The most important imperfection in the way that the stock market prices stocks is to be found in the short time horizons of the majority of investors.
- There is no statistically significant relationship between one-year forward earnings and future share price performance. (It follows that there should be no surprise that stockbroking analysts have such an indifferent record in forecasting share price performance over such short periods.)
- The same is true for earnings two years ahead. There is no statistically reliable correlation between the earnings a company will make two years ahead and its share price performance. It is only when comparing three year forward earnings with share prices that the first signs of a significant causal relationship begins to appear.
- Further analysis shows that the closest and strongest correlation between current share prices and forward earnings comes over five years, which was precisely the time horizon on which Templeton expected his analysts to concentrate when preparing their analyses of quoted companies.
- This relationship appears to hold for most markets around the world and is consistent over any period that is chosen for study. (Our analysis dates back to the mid-1970s, when the comprehensive data that allows such analysis first became available.)
- It follows that investors who can forecast, within reasonable margins of error, the five-year forward earnings for most of the stocks they own are likely to be rewarded with above average performance over that time period.
- It is no coincidence that five years happened to be Templeton’s own average holding period for the stocks in his portfolios; and also the period over which his funds most reliably outperformed the market. His intuition about five years being the critical forecasting period ultimately derived from his own experience as an investor.

> The study provides strong empirical evidence, therefore, not just that Templeton was right to focus on five-year future earnings as a key variable in stock selection, but that those who can forecast them with any degree of effectiveness can expect to be handsomely rewarded by the market. When the majority of investors are asking the wrong question, anyone who can ask the right one starts out with a huge advantage. Although he continued to study alternative methods until the end of his life, it was an article of faith with John Templeton that there was no more reliable way to produce exceptional long-term results. (真的如此吗? 就没有其他的方法了吗? Open-minded.)
