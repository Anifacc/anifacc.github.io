2.锡安山的黑门甘露 - 耶和华命定的福, 永远的生命

> 又好比黑門的甘露降在錫安山，因為在那裡有耶和華所命定的福，就是永遠的生命。- 诗篇133:3

3.殷勤做事

> “凡你手所當做的事要盡力去做；因為在你所必去的陰間沒有工作，沒有謀算，沒有知識，也沒有智慧。” ‭‭傳道書‬ ‭9:10‬ ‭

4.Develop Your Potential 

> Webster's 1828 American Dictionary of the English Language defines potential as "existing in possibility, not in act." Potential cannot manifest without form. Like concrete it must have something to be poured into, something to give it shape and make it useful. To develop potential properly you must have a plan and pray over that plan, you must have a purpose, and you must be doing something. Many people are unhappy because they aren't doing anything to develop their potential. In fact, many of them never develop their potential because they don't do anything except complain that they're not doing anything! If you want to see your potential developed to its fullness, don't wait until everything is perfect. Do something now. Start laying your hand to whatever is in front of you. You cannot start at the finish line. You must start at the beginning like everybody else. From the book Ending Your Day Right by Joyce Meyer. Copyright 2004 by Joyce Meyer. Published by FaithWords.

## 杂谈

1.养股

> 到底什么是男人成功的标准？我认为家庭完整、圆滿幸福是男人成功的唯一金标准！至于财富、地位只是实现家庭幸福的手段而已，如果一个男人财富再多、地位再高、但没有一个完整幸福的家庭、这一切还有什么意义呢？
