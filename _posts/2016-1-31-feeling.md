Lately feel so hard. Ugh, first time huh? Couldn't even believe that someday I  myself have this kind of feeling. Hmm...Gonna fly to Guangxi Province soon, and had some conversations with Jesse on FaceBook.

> Give me a address which my post cards could get you. I'll send the whole Guangxi Province to you.

Nice, nice. Too many stories seldom told...

Wish I could learn painting this year. You know, about 1,000,000,000 stories flied by everyday. And I just let them go...It's too damn stupid.

It's hard to describe the real Identity. You know what I mean by Identity? Not the social Identity, but what kind of ...people you think you are. Reading a famous book Lately, thought a lot.

I don't know if it's a good thing to yourself into a `imagine Identity`. But till now, everything seems pretty fine...

Uhh, totally have no idea what am i talking about. That's all. Nite nite.
