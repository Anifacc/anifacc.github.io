## 不可少的只有一件

> ‘… if you have faith as small as a mustard seed… nonthing will be impossible for you’ (Matthew 17:20–21). 

> “In fact, it’s easier for a camel to squeeze through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter God’s kingdom." When his disciples heard this, they were stunned. "Then who can be saved?" they asked. Jesus looked at them carefully and said, "It’s impossible for human beings. But all things are possible for God."” ‭‭Matthew‬ ‭19:24-26‬ ‭CEB‬‬ https://bible.com/37/mat.19.24-26.ceb 

With Our God, there is nonthing will be impossible. 

> Sometimes forgiving can be extremely hard. As C.S. Lewis wrote: ‘Everyone thinks forgiveness is a lovely idea until they have something to forgive.’

遇到任何事情, 站在当事人的角度思考, 或许就有不一样的结果. 生活中, 不偏待人, 不论断人, 不苛责人.

> ‘When life hands you a lemon, make lemonade,’ wrote Norman Vincent Peale, who published his best-known book, The Power of Positive Thinking, in 1952. Shane Taylor was considered one of the most dangerous men in the UK prison system. Originally jailed for attempted murder, he had his sentence extended by four years when he attacked a prison officer with a broken glass, setting off a riot. He was put in a segregation unit inside a maximum-security prison. He was given his food through a hatch. His door was not opened unless there were six officers armed with riot shields waiting outside. Later, he was transferred to Long Lartin maximum-security prison where he was invited on Alpha. During the course he prayed, ‘Jesus Christ, I know you died on a cross for me. I hate who I am; who I’ve become. Please forgive me and come into my life.’ At that moment he was filled with the Holy Spirit. He went running out onto the wing, telling everyone he could find, ‘Jesus is real!’ His behaviour changed so much that he went from living in total segregation to getting a trusted job in the prison chaplaincy. He prayed for the prison officers and for his enemies and, when he came out of prison, he got involved in a church. He met a young woman called Sam, who had also had a tough life and had been involved with drugs and criminal activity. She also came to faith in Jesus. Now, they are married and have five children. Talking to Shane now, it is hard to imagine that he is the same person who terrified so many people in the past. He has experienced ‘the wonder of [God’s] great love’ (Psalm 17:7). He says, ‘Jesus has shown me how to love and how to forgive. He has saved me. He has forgiven me for what I have done. He has turned my life around.‘ 

Jesus always loves US. He is the Way, Truth, Love.

> 一句话说得合宜，就如金苹果在银网子里。 (箴言25:11 和合本) 

言语柔和, 学会倾听, 学会说话.

> 懒惰人说：道上有猛狮，街上有壮狮。门在枢纽转动，懒惰人在床上也是如此。懒惰人放手在盘子里，就是向口撤回也以为劳乏。懒惰人看自己比七个善于应对的人更有智慧。 (箴言 26:13-16 和合本) 

凡事为主做, 勤勉, 谦卑. 

> ‘Keep me as the apple of your eye; hide me in the shadow of your wings’ (Psalm 17:8). 
>  ‘He brought me out into a spacious place; he rescued me because he delighted in me’ (Psalm 18:19).

> 我留下平安给你们；我将我的平安赐给你们。我所赐的，不像世人所赐的。你们心里不要忧愁，也不要胆怯。 (约翰福音14:27 和合本) 

> As I don’t have much physical strength, I love all these verses: ‘With my God I can scale a wall’ (Psalm 18:29); ‘It is God who arms me with strength’ (v.32); ‘He enables me to stand on the heights’ (v.33b); ‘He trains my hands for battle’ (v.34); he gives us his saving help which is my ‘shield’ (v.35a); his ‘right hand sustains me’ (v.35b). All these verses in Psalm 18 help me when I am feeling weary and physically not on top of things. These words are really encouraging. --- Pippa

智者不虑, 勇者不惧.

## 故事

1 源自:[富爸爸給女兒的120封投資信08 @ 給女兒的投資建議 :: 隨意窩 Xuite日誌](https://blog.xuite.net/venusvogue99/twblog/148954180)

> 小澤征爾是世界著名的音樂指揮家，一次，他去歐洲參加指揮家大賽，到他出場時，評委交給他一張樂譜，小澤征爾稍做準備便全神貫注地指揮起來。突然他發現樂曲中出現了一點不和諧，開始他以為是演奏錯了，就指揮樂隊停下來重奏，結果仍覺得不自然，他感到樂譜確實有問題。

> 他向在場的作曲家和評委會人士指出了這一點，可是在場的權威人士都聲明樂譜不會有問題，堅持說是他的錯覺。面對幾百位國際音樂界權威，他考慮再三，仍堅信自己的判斷是正確的，於是他大聲說：“不！一定是樂譜錯了。”他的話音剛落，評判席上那些評委們立即站立起來，向他報以熱烈的掌聲，祝賀他大賽奪魁。

> 原來這是評委們精心設計的一個圈套，以試探指揮家們在發現錯誤而權威人士不承認的情況下，是否能夠堅持自己的判斷，因為只有具備了這種素質的人，才真正稱得上是世界一流的音樂指揮家。在這些選手中，只有小澤征爾一個人堅持相信自己，並不附和權威們的意見，從而他獲得了這次世界音樂指揮家大賽的桂冠。

不迷信权威.

> 杰夫·贝佐斯问巴菲特：“你的投资体系这么简单，为什么你是全世界第二富有的人
，别人怎么不做和你一样的事情？”巴菲特回答说：“因为没有人愿意慢慢的变富。”

也没有人愿意慢慢变得更有智慧.

> 自从金价从1987年的580美元(一盎司,下同)回泻以来, 金价作为经济领先指标的作用似已渐次消失. 通胀挥之不去, 政治动荡, 油价急涨, 外汇波动甚至中东战事, 都无法刺激金价上涨, 黄金似乎变成另一种价格只受供应多寡影响的普通商品. 其实, 如果将80年代初期金价飞升那段短暂的疯狂日志剔除出来, 黄金的经济指标作用是不容忽视的. 1985年金价下挫至280元水平, 准确地预示了低油价和低通胀的来临; 1986年金价上升至420元, 1987年升至500元, 结果带动商品价格全面上扬 --- 经济学人周刊的商品期货指数, 以1986年为基数100点, 至1988年中升值170点, 显示黄金价格走在其他商品之前约6个月! 在过往2年, 金价皮不能兴, 从500元水平跌至目前(1991.05.18)的360元左右, 经济学人商品指数亦从1988年的170点跌至今年5月初的114点. 黄金的领先指标作用是至为明显的.  --- 林行止投资100谈

其实是要说明, 黄金升降对经济盛衰和通胀高下, 有不可轻视的启示作用! 但不能绝对这么理解, 不是完美一致的.
