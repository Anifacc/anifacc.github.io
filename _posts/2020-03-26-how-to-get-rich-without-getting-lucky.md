## 追求财富, 而非金钱或权位

> Seek wealth, not money or status

为什么呢？首先要清楚 财富 wealth、金钱 money、权位 status 

- 财富or金钱or权位？
	- **Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep**.   
	- Money is how we transfer time and wealth.   
	- Status is your place in the social hierarchy.
- 君子爱财，取之有道，完全可能。
	- Understand that ethical wealth creation is possible.
	- If you secretly despise wealth, it will elude you.
- 无视他人权位游戏
	- Ignore People playing status games.
	- They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creations games.
- 想要富有？
	- You're not going to get rich renting out your time.
	- You must own equity - a piece of a business - to gain your financial freedom.
- 创造社会所需，形成规模
	- **You will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not yet know to get. At scale.**
	- *Pick an industry where you can play long term games* with long term people.
	- **The Internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers.** Most people haven't figured this out yet.
- 复利游戏
	- Play *iterated* games.
	- All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from *compound interest*.
- 创业
	- Pick business partners with high intelligence, energy, and above all, *integrity*.
	- Don't partner with cynics and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling.
- 销售+创造=所向披靡
	- Learn to *sell*.
	- Learn to *build*.
	- If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.

## 武装自己: 奇技、责任、杆杆

> Arm yourself with **specific knowledge**, **accountability**, and **leverage**.

- 奇技-学徒，不可替代（护城河技能）
	- **Specific knowledge is knowledge that you cannot be trained for**. 
	- If society can train you, it can train someone else, and replace you. 
	- Specific knowledge is found by **pursuing your genuine curiosity** and **passion** rather than whatever is hot right now. 
	- **Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you** but will look like work to others. 
	- When specific knowledge is taught, it’s through apprenticeships,  not schools. 
	- Specific knowledge is often **highly technical or creative**. It cannot be outsourced or automated.
- 责任
	- **Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name.**  
 	- Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage. 
 	- The most accountable people have singular, public, and risky brands: Oprah, Trump, Kanye, Elon. 
- 杆杆: 商业
	- *“Give me a lever long enough,  and a place to stand,  I will move the earth.”*  - Archimedes 
	- Fortunes require leverage. 
	- Business leverage comes from capital, people, and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media).
		- *Capital* means money. To raise money, apply your specific knowledge, with accountability, and show resulting good judgment. 
		- *Labor* means people working for you. It's the oldest and most fought-over form of leverage.
			- Labor leverage will impress your parents, but don’t waste your life chasing it.  
 		- Capital and labour are permissioned leverage.
 			- Everyone is chasing capital, but someone has to give it to you. 
 			- Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you. 
- 代码和媒体也是杆杆  
 	- **Code and media are permissionless leverage.**
 	- They're the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep. 
 	- An army of robots is freely available - it's just packed in data centres for heat and space efficiency.  Use it. 
 	- If you can't code, write books and blogs, record videos and podcasts. 
- 判断
	- **Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgement.**
	- Judgement is making decisions. Leverage magnifies the consequences of those decisions. 
	- Judgement requires experience, but can be built faster by learning foundational skills. 
- No --生意技能--？
	- There is no skill called “business”. 
	- Avoid business magazines and business classes. 
	- Study instead **microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics, mathematics, and computers**
- 阅读并实践
	- Reading is faster than listening. 
	- Doing is faster than watching. 
	- You should be too busy to “do coffee," while still keeping an uncluttered calendar. 
- 个人时薪思维
	- Set and enforce an aspirational personal hourly rate.
	- If fixing a problem will save less than your hourly rate, ignore it.
	- If outsourcing a task will cost less than your hourly rate, outsource it. 
- 勤奋
	- Work as hard as you can.
	- Even though who you work with and what you work on are more important than how hard you work. 
	- Become the best in the world at what you do. 
	- Keep redefining what you do until this is true. 
- 没有捷径
	- There are no get rich quick schemes. 
	- That's just someone else getting rich off you. 

> **Apply specific knowledge, with leverage, and eventually you will get what you deserve.** 

> When you're finally wealthy, you'll realize that it wasn't what you were seeking in the first place. But that's for another day.
