## What Is Normal for Stock Prices?

From: Confidential Memorandum to Clients(May 17, 1954)^[1]

The economic theory developed by Templeton, Dobbrow & Vance, Inc. for calculating the normal level of stock prices is simple. There are only three elements:

1. Stock prices would be normal if they bore the same relationship to current earnings as has been customary in the latest 20 years.  
2. Stock prices would be normal if they bore the same relationship to the current cost of replacing the assets of the corporations as has been customary in the latest 20 years.  
3. When, because of changes in tax laws or changes in the money supply, high-grade preferred stocks sell lower in relation to dividends than has been customary in the last 20 years, then it should be normal for common stocks to sell lower in relation to earnings; and vice versa.

Although the theory is simple, the actual calculation involves many thousands of figures. We take care to define accurately each word used in the three principles above; and then the arithmetic is worked out on the basis of a large sample of representative stocks.

The estimate of normal based on the three principles above is valid only when applied to a diversified list of industrial common stocks. Different principles are needed if we attempt to appraise the normal for any particular stock. In order that our calculations may be always up-to-date, normal for stock prices is recalculated each month.

In the latest 20 years normal has shown a strong upward tendency, partly because of the change in the purchasing power of the dollar, but more importantly because corporations have retained (after payment of dividends) a large part of their earnings each year.

Normal for stock prices based on the principles expressed above has been computed consistently at a higher figure than the figure arrived at by any other agency attempting to calculate normal. This has meant that the clients of Templeton, Dobbrow & Vance, Inc. have been more heavily invested in common stocks and this has been a profitable situation so far.

## 何为股价正常水平^[2]

Templeton,Dobbrow and Vance公司首创用于以计算正常水平股价的方法，其经济学理论非常简单，只有以下三条原则。

（1）如果股价与当前盈利水平的关系与最近20年的一般水平保持一致，那么股价就是正常的。  
（2）如果股价与当前企业资产的重置成本的关系与最近20年的一般水平保持一致，那么股价就是正常的。   
（3）因为税法变动或货币供给量的变化，当高评级优先股与其分红的关系比最近20年的一般水平低，那么普通股股价对盈利水平更低也属于正常；反之亦然。

尽管理论很简单，实际的计算却包含上千个数据。以上三条原则中的每个字都是我们仔细斟酌后写出的；计算则是通过大量有代表性股票的样本得到的。

基于上述三条原则对正常股价的估计，仅在用于一组多样化的普通股时才是有效的。对于特定的股票，我们想要预计其正常水平需要运用不同的原则。为了让我们的计算保持时刻更新，股价的正常范围每月都会重新计算。

在最近20年，股价的正常水平呈现出很强的上浮趋势，这部分是因为美元购买力的变化，但是更重要的是因为许多企业每年（在支付利息后）都留存了大部分盈利。

基于上述原则的正常股价水平比其他尝试计算正常水平机构所得的数据更高。这意味着Templeton,Dobbrow and Vance公司的客户普通股的仓位一直以来都更重，截至目前客户的仓位已经处于盈利水平。

## 根据道指水平调仓^1

One of Templeton’s colleagues at Templeton, Dobbrow & Vance, Brevoort Stout, added some further explanatory detail of the practical issues involved in running such a program for clients. The table at the end of his memo (reproduced here as Table 2.1) illustrates how simply a client’s stock market exposure would be adjusted for different levels of the stock market, as represented by the Dow Jones Industrial Average. 

--- | Dow Jones Industrial Average Above 546 | Program Calls for No Stocks
---|---|---
Sixth Zone Above Normal  | 496–546(10%) | 10% Maximum in Stocks
Fifth Zone Above Normal  | 451–496(10%) | 20% Maximum in Stocks
Fourth Zone Above Normal | 410–451(10%) | 30% Maximum in Stocks
Third Zone Above Normal  | 373–410(10%) | 40% Maximum in Stocks
Second Zone Above Normal | 339–373(10%) | 50% Maximum in Stocks
First Zone Above Normal  | 308–339(10%) | 60% Maximum in Stocks
Normal Zone              | 293–308 | No Change Necessary
First Zone Below Normal  | 264–293(10%) | 60% Minimum in Stocks
Second Zone Below Normal | 238–264(10%) | 70% Minimum in Stocks
Third Zone Below Normal  | 214–238(10%) | 80% Minimum in Stocks
Fourth Zone Below Normal | 193–214(10%) | 90% Minimum in Stocks
---                      | Below 193 | Fully Invested in Stocks

根据市场水平, 配置在股市内的资金. 道指水平每增加10%, 股市资金就减少10%, 反之亦然. 

- 关键就是如何判断市场处于正常水平(Normal Zone). 
- 市场水平以区间表示, 任何人都无法准确预测市场.
