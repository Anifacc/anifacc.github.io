## How to Increase Your Income from Investments[^1]

From: Memorandum to Clients February 15, 1954

Any good investment research man can prepare for you within a few minutes a well-diversified list of stocks yielding over 10 percent. On the basis of market prices on February 10th and the dividends paid in the last 12 months, Van Norman Company yields 10.5 percent, Moore-McCormack Lines 11 percent, Barker Brothers 11.7 percent, Pond Creek Pocahontas 11.9 percent, Butte Copper 12.3 percent, Nash-Kelvinator 12.8 percent, Pacific Tin 13.0 percent, Great Northern Iron Ore 13.0 percent, Inspiration Consolidated Copper 13.1 percent, and Roan Antelope Mines 15.6 percent. These are all well established corporations with shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

This is an easy method for increasing your income from investments; but it is the worst of all methods. Stocks sell at low prices in relation to current dividends usually because there are good reasons for expecting that the dividend may be reduced. Investors selecting stocks with high current yield face not only the risk of reduced dividends but also the greater risk of capital losses.

A far wiser method for increasing your income is to select stocks with the highest earnings in relation to market price. This will usually mean that your stocks have good prospects for paying increased dividends rather than prospects for paying reduced dividends. Many good stocks can now be found whose annual earnings are more than 15 percent of the market price.

Such earnings are partly reinvested by the company for the benefit of stockholders which, in turn, leads to still higher earnings per share in future years. Of course, in seeking such stocks you should skip those whose earnings are high for one or two years for abnormal reasons and search rather for those likely to have a high level of earnings for many years in the future.

In the endeavor to increase your income, it is wise also to select growth stocks. Growth stocks are most likely to earn more and pay increased dividends in future years. Usually growth companies have a high rate of earnings in relation to net worth. By retaining a large share of its earnings each year a growth company may be able to double its net assets per share within a relatively few years; and this in turn may lead to increased earnings and dividends.

Another sound method, with which our clients are thoroughly familiar, is to reduce the percentage held in common stocks when the stock market rises far above normal and then in turn to increase the percentage in common stocks when the stock market declines far below normal. At first thought it may seem strange to speak of increasing your income by taking part of your money out of common stocks (when stock prices are high) in order to create a reserve of top-grade bond which usually have low yields.

However, the importance of having a reserve and the use of such reserve to achieve an increase in income will become apparent the next time common stock prices are really low. Then the reserve can be used to purchase more common stocks at prices that are really low in relation to probable earnings and dividends of future years.

For example, let us assume that the stock of X company is paying, and will continue to pay, $1.50 annually in dividends. It may be possible at some time to sell such stock at $30, hold the proceeds temporarily in 3 percent bonds, and then within a few years use this reserve to repurchase at $20, three shares of the same stock for each two shares previously held. This method accomplishes no temporary increase in income with accompanying risk, but rather a solid and permanent increase of income in the long run.

For the purpose of increasing your income, constant watchfulness is also important. Prices of common stocks fluctuate very widely. It is often possible to sell a stock whose price is too high in relation to value and use the proceeds for the purchase at the same time of another stock whose price is too low in relation to its value. Transactions which increase the intrinsic value of your list of investments usually lead to increases in income in the long run.

The Templeton, Dobbrow & Vance Model Fund which started September 30, 1943 can serve as an example of the increased income resulting from the methods mentioned briefly in the four preceding paragraphs. This fund started with a capital of exactly $100,000; and although it is only 68 percent invested in common stocks, it is now earning income at the rate of $11,213 annually, or 11.2 percent of cost. As one more example, consider the case of Mr. M. whose fund of $276,000 was first placed under our investment counsel management exactly 15 years ago. Although this fund is now only 57 percent invested in common stocks, the income is $30,780 annually, which is 10.9 percent of cost.

By using the methods mentioned above, you may increase your income on a sound and permanent basis. Also, these methods should increase both the safety and the capital growth of your investments.
